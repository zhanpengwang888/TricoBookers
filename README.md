## Project Description

*Textbooks are expensive and become useless for students who have taken the course. We developed an android app that enables Trico students to exchange textbooks with each other.*

## Protoype Summary

* We provide search suggestions based on the keywords students typed, and quick match between potential sellers and buyers. For sellers, we provide a basic interface for them to upload their information and selling price of certain books. It's a fast safe, reliable and cost-efficient way to circulate the textbooks among Trico community
